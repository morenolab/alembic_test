## Human Evolutionary and Population Genomics

The Moreno Lab studies genetic diversity and host–pathogen interactions to better understand disease risk and population health, with a focus on Latin American populations.

## Research Areas

### Population Genomics
We investigate patterns of genetic diversity, ancestry, and demographic history to understand population structure and its implications for health and disease.

### Host–Pathogen Interactions
Our work integrates genomics and serological data to study infectious disease susceptibility and immune response variation.

### Biostatistics & Data Science
We develop and apply scalable analytical pipelines for large-scale genomic and phenotypic datasets.
